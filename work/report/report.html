            <section>
                <h2>S01</h2>
                <p><em>- Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</em><br>
                I have used Git and Git and Github previously in other courses. I've heard of both Markdown and Github Pages and read about them but never used them.</p>

                <p><em>- Have you ever created websites before?</em><br>
                Yes but simple ones. I created basic websites on my own using HTML and CSS.</p>

                <p><em>- Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</em><br>
                As I mentioned before I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS. For backend I have played around with Node.js and Spring Boot but never worked on any project, just my own leisure. For the Mobile Development course project I used PHP and MySQL. In Software Engineering II, I worked with Java servlets and XML parsing.</p>

                <p><em>- What is your TIL for this course section?</em><br>
                Today I learned how to use Github Pages, fork a Github repo and keep it updated.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>S02</h2>
                <p><em>- Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</em><br>
                Yes. I practiced on my own free time with HTML and CSS mostly.</p>

                <p><em>- Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</em><br>
                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup language and is the standard language to write documents to be displayed in web browsers.<br>
                CSS stands for Cascade Style Sheets and is used to style HTML documents.<br>
                Javascript is a programming language that can be used for both front and backend web development. It allows for dynamic content, for example handling events or creating/modifying elements in a webpage.</p>

                <p><em>- Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</em><br>
                Yes. I practiced on my own free time with HTML and CSS mostly.</p>

                <p><em>- Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</em><br>
                The browser's function is to display webpages in a human readable format. In order to do so, it contacts a web server where HTML documents are kept. The communication between them is made using the HTTP protocol.<br>
                When a browser needs to load a web page, that is not cached locally, it sents a HTTP GET request to the page's web server, if the request is successful the web server will reply back with the needed HTML document and the web browser can then display the webpage.</p>

                <p><em>- What is your TIL for this course section?</em><br>
                For this section I mostly learned CSS related content. I read about using Flexbox in CSS in order to position elements in HTML pages and used that knowledge to complete the assignment.
                I had dificulties keeping the footer always at the bottom of the pages, but with help from Flexbox tutorials I was able to do it.</p>
