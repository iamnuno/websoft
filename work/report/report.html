                <h2>S01</h2>
                <p><em>- Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</em><br>
                I have used Git and Git and Github previously in other courses. I've heard of both Markdown and Github Pages and read about them but never used them.</p>

                <p><em>- Have you ever created websites before?</em><br>
                Yes but simple ones. I created basic websites on my own using HTML and CSS.</p>

                <p><em>- Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</em><br>
                As I mentioned before I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS. For backend I have played around with Node.js and Spring Boot but never worked on any project, just my own leisure. For the Mobile Development course project I used PHP and MySQL. In Software Engineering II, I worked with Java servlets and XML parsing.</p>

                <p><em>- What is your TIL for this course section?</em><br>
                Today I learned how to use Github Pages, fork a Github repo and keep it updated.</p>
